# Delhi Metro Navigation Project

This project provides an efficient way to navigate the Delhi Metro system by calculating both the shortest and most economical routes between two stations. It also includes a feature to find the nearest metro station to popular tourist destinations like India Gate.

## Features
- **Shortest Path**: Finds the shortest route between two stations using Breadth-First Search (BFS).
- **Most Economical Path**: Calculates the most economical path based on Delhi Metro's fare system using Dijkstra's Algorithm.
- **Tourist Support**: Locates the nearest metro station to popular tourist spots, such as India Gate.

## How to Run

1. **Compile the code**:
    ```bash
    g++ metro.cpp
    ```

2. **Run the application**:
    ```bash
    ./a.out
    ```

3. **Follow the menu options** to:
   - Find the shortest path.
   - Find the most economical path.
   - Locate the nearest metro station to a tourist destination.

## Requirements
- C++ compiler (e.g., g++)
- Terminal or command line interface
